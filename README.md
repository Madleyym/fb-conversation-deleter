## 📋 How It Works

1. **Paste** the script into your browser console
2. **Press Enter** to start execution
3. Script **keeps** your 20 most recent conversations (customizable)
4. **Deletes** conversations starting from #21 down to the oldest
5. **Stops automatically** when only your desired number of chats remain

The script uses cursor-assisted filtering to ensure accurate conversation targeting, working seamlessly as long as Facebook's HTML structure remains unchanged.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Permanent Deletion**

- ⚠️ Deleted conversations **CANNOT be recovered**
- ⚠️ This action is **PERMANENT**
- ⚠️ Make sure you want to delete before running

### **Facebook Structure Dependency**

- Script relies on Facebook's current DOM structure
- May break if Facebook updates their HTML/CSS
- Test on a small number first to verify functionality

### **Manual Stop**

To stop the script at any time:

- Refresh the page (`F5`)
- Close the tab
- Restart your browser

### **Rate Limiting**

- Script includes delays to avoid triggering Facebook's rate limits
- Deleting very large numbers of conversations may take time
- Do not reduce wait times too much to avoid issues

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Script doesn't start

- ✅ Ensure you're on `facebook.com/messages`
- ✅ Check console for errors (red text)
- ✅ Verify you pasted the entire script
- ✅ Make sure conversations are loaded in sidebar

### Menu button not found

- ✅ Scroll to ensure conversations are visible
- ✅ Facebook may have changed their UI
- ✅ Try refreshing and running again

### Delete option not found

- ✅ Your Facebook language settings may differ
- ✅ Script supports "Delete" and "Hapus" (Indonesian)
- ✅ Edit script to add your language keyword

### Stops unexpectedly

- ✅ Check console for error messages
- ✅ Facebook may have rate-limited your actions
- ✅ Wait a few minutes and try again
